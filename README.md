# Todo-Task

Todo-Task is a React app to create todos.
It will call rails api from backend to perform CRUD Operation.

# Motivation

I never created Rails API and react-app seperately. So my curiosity to learn new things make this happen.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Dependency

To run this application you must need to start rails Api First.
You can clone Rails API repo from https://github.com/TrishaPatel/todo-tasks-api.
Before starting React app you need to start rails server.

# Proxy in Package.json

In Package.json, proxy server is set to 3000(default rails server).
If your rails is running on another server you need to change the port.
